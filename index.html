                        <p>Hi there, and welcome to my website! My name is Camilo, 
                            I was born in Havana, Cuba, but raised in Miami, 
                            Florida, and now I'm entering my third year of 
                            studying mechanical engineering with a focus on 
                            robotics as an undergraduate at Caltech.</p>
                        <p>Ever since I was little, I've kept myself busy 
                            exploring new passions and learning through projects
                             and hobbies, but I never had a place to share and
                              reflect on these creations... until now! I 
                              have a big backlog of projects that I want to put 
                              on here, as well as some upcoming projects that 
                              I'm very excited to share!  Occasionally I'll also
                               sprinkle in some other fun highlights of my 
                               activities.</p>
                        <p>Please take a look around!</p>

                        <p>I had the incredible opportunity to work on a
                            two-stage transmission project with an amazing
                            team as part of Caltech's Design and Fabrication 
                            class, which is a core requirement and, in many 
                            ways, a rite of passage for Mechanical Engineering 
                            students here. We were given a tight timeline and 
                            budget of around two weeks and $200 to design, 
                            build, and test our transmission. Transmissions 
                            were scored based on their maximum speed (in rpm) 
                            divided by the time taken for it to reach 250 rpm,
                            and our team won!

                                It exercised everything from engineering design and 
                                communication, team building and coordination, 
                                performance prediction modeling, timeline

                                so much more. I highly encourage you to check out my 
                                Engineering Notebook. Just hover over it with your mouse
                                to get started. It goes into way more detail than
                                I could ever cover on here! I can only hope future
                                class projects will be as fun and rewarding as this one.

                            <p>Here's a test run I recorded that shows our transmission 
                                running. The  test rig it is mounted on has a sensor to 
                                measure the output rpm, but we weren't allowed to
                                use it before the competition. However, we were still
                                able to estimate our score by recording tests like
                                this one in slo-mo, and then counting the number of 
                                revolutions of the bike wheel during a 5-10 second
                                interval (real-time) to then extrapolate its rpm.
                                These tests helped us realize that we needed to improve
                                our second stage in order to win, and are just one
                                of the ways that our team thought outside of the box!

                        <p>It's not often that a student-led class has the budget
                            to allow students to buy state-of-the-art hardware to
                            work on projects of their choosing. That's why this 
                            class was such a unique learning opportunity. I primarily
                            took this chance to learn more about electronics and
                            how to incorporate power considerations into engineering
                            designs. My team's project idea was to make tethered 
                            robots that could cooperate to descend and ascend craters 
                            for exploration missions. I integrated our robot's 
                            computer, camera, motor, motor controller, and steering 
                            servo. I made the system hot-swappable so that it 
                            could be powered by our LiPo Batteries, or tested on
                            a stand while connected to wall power. Along the way,
                            I picked up useful skills such as soldering and a bit
                            of ROS. Here's an electrical diagram with the key 
                            components of our robot so far:

                            <p>We used a <a target="blank" href="https://traxxas.com/products/landing/maxx/">
                                Traxxas Max</a> as the base of our chassis, but 
                                replaced the electronics to better suit our needs.
                                The Traxxas Maxx motor only had two pole-pairs so
                                it was difficult to control precisely. We also 
                                custom-made the larger wheels to prevent the robot
                                from bottoming-out, and added treads to reduce
                                slippage on granular terrain. Here's a video of 
                                the our first integrated hardware test (note that
                                this was before steering had been implemented). 
                                It's astonishing how much work it can take just 
                                to get a robot to this stage when working with
                                novel hardware

                                This was the first time I ever worked with ROS. We
                                used it to communicate between a Logitech remote 
                                controller, our Jetson Orin Nano, the Traxxas' 
                                steering servo, and the microcontroller that controlled
                                the servo. After dozens of hours of troubleshooting
                                the steering system, and switching our microcontroller
                                from a faulty RP2040 to the Teensy 4.0, my teammate 
                                and I finally got it to work! This is was one of
                                the most satisfying and relieving moments of my 
                                academic career.

                                project is still a long way from completion. The tether-management system is practically 
                                in its infancy. I worked on a MATLAB script a while 
                                back to actively calculate the lengths of the tether 
                                segments between robots and the anchor winch. However, 
                                much of the hardware needed to start implementing 
                                this has yet to be developed. I hope to be able to
                                continue this project throughout the year!

                        <p> Through Caltech's introductory course on robotics, I
                            learned about the fundamentals of smooth motor control
                            and computer vision to make a gimbal robot that fluidly
                            tracks the position of an object (a tennis ball in 
                            this particular case). Sadly I didn't save videos of
                            the final robot actively tracking the ball, but below
                            I have demonstrations of these functions independently
                            — the gimbal moving smoothly and the camera vision

                    <div class="entry full">
                        <p>I cannot overstate the role that my participation in 
                            the Mecha Makos Robotics Club at my high school played
                            in enabling me to explore my passion for mechanical 
                            engineering. I would scour through robotics forums
                            and youtube videos to learn how to improve our robots.
                            I taught myself how to use 3D modeling software so
                            that I could work on designs from home and quickly
                            create drawings and renders for our engineering notebook.
                            Then, my desire to improve our robots' autonomous 
                            programs for competitions motivated me to also learn
                            how to code. Over the course of my four years, I easily
                            put in a few-thousand hours into this club. Each robot
                            was a massive project on its own. Collectively,
                            they cemented my passion for robotics and catapulted
                            my engineering skills to new heights.

                                During the pandemic, I poured hundreds of hours 
                                into designing our robot in Fusion360. This is 
                                one of that robot's earliest iterations. Looking
                                back, it was such a great use of all my extra time at home!
                                I learned to make subsequent iterations progressively
                                simpler, following the KISS design principle so 
                                that we would be able to quickly build this robot
                                when we returned to in-person schooling. 3D modelling
                                broke down the previous years' limitation of only
                                being able to work on these robots for 2 hours a
                                week during our regular club meetings. This skills
                                helped me elevate our robots to new competitive heights!

                                communicate them with others in a way that 
                                hand-drawn sketches (no matter how detailed they are) just

                                before we were able to build our own field 
                                at school! This was great for getting a sense of
                                the scale of these elements in relation to the robot.

                                felt so surreal! Since the robot was fully CADed,
                                I was able to give each team member a component 
                                to assemble. As a result, we built the robot and
                                started testing it within a matter of days!

                            control loops to achieve greater reliability. The

                        that explore interesting perspectives. These are a few 
                        of my works.

                            Actually, I love just about anything that involves being
                            in or on the water, from kayaking to swimming pools to 
                            water parks.
